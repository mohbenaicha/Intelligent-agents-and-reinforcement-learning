It's best to download the files together in a single directory and use the ipynb to simulate training without renaming any of .py source code files.

1. Simple nested loop application of a naive wumpus world agent

2. Simple nested loop application of a naive wumpus world agent + shortest return pat

3. OOP-esque application of probabilistic reasoning agent using bayesian networks

4. Deep reinforcement Q-learning agent
