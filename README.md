# Wumpus-world-naive-beeline-probablistic-DQNN-agent

This repo isn't organized into sub packages. Instead, it's best to download the files together in a single directory and use the ipynb to simulate training without renaming any of .py module files.

1. Simple nested loop application of a naive wumpus world agent developed from scratch

2. Simple nested loop application of a naive wumpus world agent + shortest return path developed from scratch

3. OOP-esque application of probabilistic reasoning agent using bayesian networks developed form scratch

4. Enahncements to the deep reinforcement Q-learning agent in Zai and Brown
